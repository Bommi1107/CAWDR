Cloud Aggregator with Disaster Recovery

Overview

The Cloud Aggregator with Disaster Recovery (CAWDR) project addresses the critical challenges faced by organizations in managing and protecting cloud-based data. This solution provides a unified platform for integrating cloud services across multiple providers (AWS and Azure) and offers robust disaster recovery capabilities to ensure minimal downtime and data loss during disruptions.

Features

Cross-Cloud Interoperability: Seamlessly integrates AWS and Azure cloud platforms for enhanced resource management.

Real-Time Data Replication: Continuous data synchronization at the block level to reduce potential data loss.

Automated Failover and Failback: Effortless transition between primary and backup environments during disasters.

Monitoring and Alerts: Real-time system health checks and alert mechanisms for proactive issue management.

User-Friendly Interface: Web-based dashboard for system configuration, monitoring, and control.

Architecture

The system leverages a dual-cloud architecture, featuring:

Primary Environment: Hosted on AWS for normal operations.

Secondary Environment: Mirrored setup on Azure for disaster recovery.

Failover Controller: Automated traffic redirection during service disruptions.

Monitoring Layer: Tracks system health and performance in real-time.
